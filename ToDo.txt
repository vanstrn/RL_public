Modular Run Scripts
  Verify Synchronous Script Functionality
  Modify Asynchronous Script to Function with modified structure.

Modular Network
  Clean implementation and add documentation/comments.

Environment Integration
  Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with Gridworld environment.
  Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with CTF environment.

A2C
  Clean Formating

A3C
  Clean Formating

PPO
  N/A

TRPO
  Implement

ACKTR
  Implement

Q Learning
  Implement

Hierarchical Networks
  Implement losses in the method - Optional losses for policy divergence.
  Implement Confidence in the method

ELO System
  Implement

Multiple Parallel Training of Networks
  Implement
  Train Multiple networks by estimating memory usage and if over capacity cycle through the networks.
  Implement Process which selects which trainings to cut and how to fork successful training.
  Used for ELO training or for Multi-Agent Systems.

Replay Buffers
  Create Buffer sample data in batches.
  Create Experience Replay buffer which will hold onto important Tuples.

Move to TF2
  Keras implementation should be similar. Check background functions.

State Prediction Loss
  Merge into PPO and have option for different losses and network usages.

Switch to environment wrappers as they are cut down on run script.

Fix memory leak
  Location of memory leak has been identified as GAE Normalization. 
  Source was that the actual call created additional method and array every function call.
  Fix the memory leak.
