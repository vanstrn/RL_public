Modular Run Scripts
  Reorganize the run scripts between Synchronous and Asynchronous Runs.
  Change the saving and loging functions so that they don't need to be exact integer values to log/save values.

Modular Network
  Implement Recursive Elements in Network Design.
  Allow two outputs to be concatenated for another layer.
  Allow for multiple end outputs instead of specifying one "actionSize".
  Allow a hidden state dictionary to be passed through, which can be routed to the next iteration of the environment
    -Needs to be included in all method files as this is where it will be stored.
    -Needs to be added to the buffer.

Multiple Parallel Training of Networks
  Implement
  Train Multiple networks by estimating memory usage and if over capacity cycle through the networks.
  Implement Process which selects which trainings to cut and how to fork successful training.

Replay Buffers
