Environment Integration
  Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with CTF environment.

A2C & A3C
  Clean Formating

PPO
  Clean Formating and test

SF
  Test.
  Fix value function estimation

Q Learning
  Implement

Hierarchical Networks
  Implement losses in the method - Optional losses for policy divergence.
  Implement Confidence in the method

ELO System
  Implement

Multiple Parallel Training of Networks
  Implement
  Train Multiple networks by estimating memory usage and if over capacity cycle through the networks.
  Implement Process which selects which trainings to cut and how to fork successful training.
  Used for ELO training or for Multi-Agent Systems.

Replay Buffers
  Create Buffer sample data in batches.
  Create Experience Replay buffer which will hold onto important Tuples.

Move to TF2
  Keras implementation should be similar. Check background functions.

Switch to environment wrappers as they are cut down on run script.

Buffers
  Experience buffer
  Improve Trajectory by preventing samples that are done from adding new samples.
