Modular Run Scripts
  Reorganize the run scripts so that they are compatible between different Network training architectures (PPO/A3C...)
  Make the definition of the training architecture be made in a Config File and not hard coded.

Modular Network
  Create JSON files that describe current CTF architecture
  Implement the appropriate layers in the dynamic Network Structure Code.

CTF Integration
  Test A2C and A3C with CTF environment.

PPO
  Implement.
  Test with Cart Pole.
  Test with CTF.

Hierarchical Networks
  Smartly Linking the Networks in Training (Have Separate Network in the JSON File)
  Create Hierarchy Method.

Recurrent Networks
  Create modular network definition for Recurrent networks and LSTMs
