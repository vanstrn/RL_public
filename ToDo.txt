Restructure Variables so code between A2C/A3C/PPO are compatible in Run scripts.
  Attach buffers to the A2C/A3C method and have it store any variables that it needs.

CNN network
  Modular Input format
  Default input is the structure for CtF

A2C

A3C
  Clean Up A3C Code
  Attach buffer to A3C

PPO
  Implement

Recurrent Networks
  -LSTM Blocks

Hierarchical Networks
  -Smartly Linking the Training

DNN
  Add input that allows for different naming of the the sub-netowrks (Ex variable name for 'critic' and 'actor')
