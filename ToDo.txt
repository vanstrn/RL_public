Environment Integration
  Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with Gridworld environment.
  Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with CTF environment.

A2C
  Clean Formating

A3C
  Clean Formating

PPO
  N/A

Q Learning
  Implement

Hierarchical Networks
  Implement losses in the method - Optional losses for policy divergence.
  Implement Confidence in the method

ELO System
  Implement

Multiple Parallel Training of Networks
  Implement
  Train Multiple networks by estimating memory usage and if over capacity cycle through the networks.
  Implement Process which selects which trainings to cut and how to fork successful training.
  Used for ELO training or for Multi-Agent Systems.

Replay Buffers
  Create Buffer sample data in batches.
  Create Experience Replay buffer which will hold onto important Tuples.

Move to TF2
  Keras implementation should be similar. Check background functions.

Reformat losses
  Make different losses optional in the networks.

Switch to environment wrappers as they are cut down on run script.

Switch to Moving Average

Update all Save Statistics so they are uniform.
