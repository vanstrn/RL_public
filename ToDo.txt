Modular Run Scripts
  -Reorganize the run scripts between Synchronous and Asynchronous Runs.
    *Verify Synchronous Script Functionality
    *Modify Asynchronous Script to Function with modified structure.

Modular Network
  -Implement Recursive Elements(LSTM) in Network Design.
  -Allow for more environment information to pass to the network to allow it to dynamically resize. (State shape?)
    *Allow dynamic sizing of reconstruction module

Environment Integration
  -Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with Gridworld environment.
  -Test A2C, A3C, and PPO with CTF environment.

A2C
  -Clean Formatting

A3C
  -Clean Formatting
  -Change saving to save global network

TRPO
  -Implement

ACKTR
  -Implement

Q Learning
  -Implement

Successor Feature Representation
  -Implement training method

Hierarchical Networks
  -Implement losses in the method - Optional losses for policy divergence.
  -Implement Confidence in the method

Recurrent Networks
  -Create modular network definition for Recurrent networks and LSTMs

ELO System
  -Implement

Multiple Parallel Training of Networks
  -Implement
  -Train Multiple networks by estimating memory usage and if over capacity cycle through the networks.
  -Implement Process which selects which trainings to cut and how to fork successful training.
  -Used for ELO training or for Multi-Agent Systems.

Replay Buffers
  -Create Buffer sample data in batches.
  -Create Experience Replay buffer which will hold onto important Tuples.

Move to TF2
  -Keras implementation should be similar. Check background functions.
  -Improve training speed.
    *Gradient tape method seems to be slow
    *have loss functions be @tf.functions
    *switch back to keras optimizer gradients. Had issues with gradient tracking and backpropagation.

Envs
  -Replace functions with dedicated wrappers.

Genetic Neural Networks
  -Get details of implementation. Use ELO as genetic parameter.
